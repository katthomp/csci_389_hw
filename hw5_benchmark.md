-how fast does the server respond to several requests (scaling by the scale of requests)

-test different workloads
	-something where there’s a lot of GET requests, many invalid

	-many SET requests
	-mix of SET/GET
	-mix of SET/DELETE
	-basically go by the workloads described in Eitan’s paper

Did it do the request/handle, crashes appropriately


—ideally have different simulation files that collect data for each workload, and generate plots/graphs based on data
