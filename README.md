*Disclaimer: We know from our investigation into the CPU cache sizes of our machine that our data is inaccurate. Our graph should show discrete jumps in function at 32 KB(L1 cache), 256 KB(L2 cache), and 4072KB(L3 cache).*

1. Our values grow very linearly (which clearly shows that they're incorrect), so it's impossible to infer cache sizes from the graph. If our numbers had come out as expected, we would expect to see a clear jump in time right after 32KB, 256KB, and 4072KB, as those are the sizes of the L1, L2, and L3 caches, respectively, on the computer we used to run our code.

2. Nope. Because our code is broken? It's also possible that our processors could be slower or faster than what they say  

3.
